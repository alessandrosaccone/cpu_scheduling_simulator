# cpu_scheduling_simulator

A preemptive SJF scheduler with quantum prediction based on a fake os with a fake allocation of processes.

The commit message "aggiorno" are due to an alias used for general and not fundamental commits {e.g. the update of the README.md file, the change of the name of some variables in the entire code or the adding of simple functions (akin to "is_empty" one)}
[alias: commit -> git commit -m "aggiorno"]
